# Steganography :
Steganography is a method in which presence of a secret data in an image/video/audio cannot be detected and thus can be used as a tool for security purpose to transmit highly confidential information in an secure way. The image is hidden in such a way that it is almost not visible by human visual. It has a vast number of applications in the fields of defense and intelligence, online banking, medical, online transaction and other commercial and financial purposes.

As the technology has evolved, many new approaches/techniques have been made to hide the confidential information within the other cover objects like image, video, text etc. Here, in our project we will be focusing on image steganography which uses another image as a cover model to hide the confidential information which is embedded into the cover object as noise.
